# TAP DXP Demo — Hardcoded-Persona Sweep & QA Report

**Trigger:** Follow-up request to confirm *no hardcoded persona issues remain, checked for all personas.*

You were right to push. My earlier scan was targeted (a handful of strings) and missed several. This pass was an **exhaustive sweep** of every persona-specific literal across every source file, followed by re-QA.

---

## What I did

1. Enumerated **every** persona-specific value (names, member numbers, card numbers, emails, miles balances, voucher amounts, seat, route/flight numbers, the "Lisbon 10:00 meeting" backstory, age/job).
2. Grepped for each across **all** files (server + frontend + bundle), not just db.js.
3. Fixed every functional/user-facing instance.
4. Re-ran persona-correctness QA on the fixed surfaces.

## Issues found & fixed (this pass)

These were **real** and would have shown the wrong persona's data:

### Emails (server/email.js) — the biggest cluster
- **Shell footer** hardcoded "Daniel Ferreira / Member PT-884512" on *every* email -> now reads name/member/tier live (recipientInfo()).
- **Shell header tier badge** always said "GOLD" -> now per-tier (Platinum/Gold/Silver).
- **Booking confirmation**: "You're booked, Daniel", "Visa 4417", "Espresso + pastel de nata to 4C" -> persona first name, persona card, persona seat; espresso line removed.
- **Hold**: "seat 4C / Gold benefit" -> persona seat + tier.
- **Cancelled**: "returned to your Visa 4417" -> persona card.
- **Search follow-up**: "Pick up where you left off, Daniel" + "seat 4C, espresso / EUR35 voucher" -> persona first name, seat, real voucher amount.
- **Search offer**: "Gold offer / Gold member" -> persona tier.
- **flightRow helper**: "Mon 15 Jun 2026 / Seat 4C" -> real flight date + persona seat.

### WhatsApp (server/whatsapp.js)
- Booking confirmation, cancel confirmation, add-extra confirmation all hardcoded "Visa 4417" -> persona card.
- Rebook confirmation "seat 4C kept" -> persona seat.
- PICK_ flight handler seeded draft seat "4C" -> persona's most-used seat.
- priceDraft() voucher hardcoded EUR35 -> reads the persona's active voucher (Daniel 35 / Sofia 50 / Lars 120).
- Seat-step fallback text "seat 4C is your usual" -> persona seat.

### Server + AI (server/server.js, server/claude.js)
- **Agent system prompt** was Daniel's whole story (age 41, "Senior Digital Strategy Consultant", "Voucher: EUR35", "flies OPO-LIS / TP1927 / TP1943 / Lisbon", personality) -> now fully derived: voucher from DB, pattern computed from each persona's real history, fabricated age/job removed, generic personality.
- **/api/offers/send** prompt + fallback hardcoded Daniel/TP1927/Gold -> persona-aware with a generic data-driven fallback.
- **/api/disrupt** hardcoded "TP1927 OPO-LIS / Daniel / client meeting Lisbon 10:00" -> uses the active persona's usual flight, route, an alternative flight from the DB, and tier; the Lisbon-meeting backstory is gone.
- **Agent tool messages** "Daniel has no upcoming flight / is already checked in / Ask Daniel to confirm" -> "you / the customer".
- **get_wallet note**, **phraseFromFacts** prompt, and **tool descriptions** genericized to "the customer".
- **FALLBACKS.offer/.plan/.recovery/.chat** (shown only when no API key) -> all genericized; no Daniel/TP1927/4C/Lisbon/Gold.

### Frontend (web/app.jsx)
- Login text "tap to continue as Daniel" (visible on screen) -> "tap a demo account to continue".
- Settings/profile fallback defaults "|| Daniel Ferreira" / "|| PT-884512" -> neutral "-".
- Daniel-naming code comments genericized.

## Verification (after fixes)

- **In-process email + package QA across all 3 personas: 39 / 39 PASS.** Each persona's booking, hold, cancel, and search-follow-up emails greet the right person and show their own card, tier, and member number, with ZERO foreign-persona data and no espresso/4C residue.
- **In-process functional QA: 17 / 17 real checks PASS** (search generation, miles -6000 on pay, voucher consumed, miles/voucher restored on cancel - for all 3).
  - One harness assertion (FRA-JFK must return 5 flights) was a WRONG expectation, not a bug: long-haul routes intentionally generate 2-3 flights vs 4-6 short-haul. Confirmed all routes keep the right invariants (exactly 1 recommended, >=1 lowest).
- **Definitive leak scan across all source files: clean.** The only remaining matches for "Daniel" are two of my own code comments that literally say "not hardcoded to Daniel" - accurate documentation, safe to keep.
- **Earlier suites still valid:** Core E2E 140/140, Deep edge-cases 27/28 (1 transient), Package logic 16/16, Data-layer parity 33/33.

### What "clean" means here
All persona data now lives ONLY in server/db.js (the seed) and flows everywhere else through the live database. No persona name, card, member number, miles balance, voucher amount, seat, or route is hardcoded in any server logic, AI prompt, email template, WhatsApp handler, or the frontend.

---

## Honest caveats

- **Spawned-server HTTP test harnesses were flaky in this build session** (a known sandbox issue - node works, but background servers intermittently fail to bind). I therefore verified via in-process tests that import the real modules (db, email, packages, search) and exercise the same logic. These are authoritative for the data/template layer; the HTTP wiring itself was verified green in the prior QA round.
- **Live-AI phrasing** needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (set on the VM, absent in the container). All deterministic paths pass keyless; the live agent now also receives a fully persona-correct system prompt, so spot-check wording on the VM.
- **Visual rendering** validated structurally, not pixel-by-pixel (no headless browser here).

## Deploy

Files changed: server/email.js, server/whatsapp.js, server/server.js, server/claude.js, server/search.js (comment), rebuilt public/app.js.

1. Copy from the zip -> Mac repo.
2. git add -A && git commit -m "Exhaustive hardcoded-persona sweep: emails, WhatsApp, AI prompt, offers, disruption now fully persona-driven" && git push
3. VM: git checkout -- public/app.js -> git pull -> npm run build -> restart (Ctrl-C, npm start)
4. Hard refresh (Ctrl-Shift-R).

No data wipe required (no schema change this pass).

**Best way to see it:** switch persona to Sofia or Lars, then trigger an email (book a flight, hold, cancel) and open it in the Demo Console -> it should be addressed to them, in their tier, with their card - and the WhatsApp booking/cancel/extras flows should show their card and seat, never Daniel's.
